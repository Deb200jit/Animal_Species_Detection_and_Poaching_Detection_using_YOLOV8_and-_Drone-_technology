Our project integrates cutting-edge Computer Vision Surveillance and Drone Technology, powered by the YOLOv8 algorithm. With a team of six members, we've developed a system to detect and monitor wildlife, identify unknown species, and swiftly detect poachers in real-time, revolutionizing conservation efforts for our planet's ecosystems.

#Topic: Integrating Computer Vision Surveillance and Drone Technology for Wildlife Monitoring and Conservation

#Project Overview:
This project aims to revolutionize wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts by integrating cutting-edge Computer Vision Surveillance with Drone Technology. Leveraging the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 algorithm, our team of six members has developed a comprehensive system to detect and monitor wildlife species, identify unknown species, and detect poachers in real-time.

#Key Features:
1. Animal Species Detection
Our system can accurately identify various wildlife species from drone footage, providing valuable insights into biodiversity and helping track animal populations over time.

2. Unknown Species Detection
Using advanced computer vision techniques, our system can detect previously unknown species, contributing to scientific research and expanding our understanding of wildlife.

3. Poacher Detection
The project includes a robust poacher detection feature, enabling real-time identification of poachers to enhance anti-poaching efforts and protect endangered species.

#Technology Stack:
1) Drone Technology: High-resolution drones equipped with advanced sensors for capturing detailed aerial footage.
Computer Vision Algorithm: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and classification.
2) Programming Languages: Python, along with relevant libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow, Ultraltytics, PyTorch.

#How It Works
1) Data Collection: Drones capture high-resolution videos and images of wildlife habitats.
2) Preprocessing: Footage is preprocessed to enhance quality and prepare for analysis.
3) Detection and Classification: The YOLOv8 algorithm detects and classifies species, unknown animals, and potential poachers in real-time.
Monitoring and Alerts: The system provides real-time monitoring and sends alerts for any detected poachers or unidentified species.
4) Data Analysis: Collected data is analyzed to generate insights and reports for wildlife conservation efforts.
